# First-Coding-Refactor



This repository will hold the content of my first coding refactor challenge, which covers some semantic HTML elements, basic concepts of CSS, and Git.


Description
--

In this first challenge assignment, I have to improve the **HTML** structure of the given starter code, consolidate its CSS code, and use some of the basic concepts of Git and GitHub. These are the three main points of interest of this discussion.

First, I clone the stater code from GitHub in my local repository. From there, I replace the `<div>` elements with the semantic HTML elements. I also have to support the `<img />` element with additional detailed information about the image within ` the alt=” ” ` attribute. This underlines good coding practice principles, since semantic HTML elements describe the information they communicate. Semantic elements, like `<nav>`, `<section>` offer many advantages over other HTML (HyperText Markup Language) elements like `div`. Reader accessibility and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) are two other main reasons for using as many semantic HTML elements within our code when is necessary.

External Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) selectors provide us with some convenient ways to maintain web applications, to adjust the feel and look of the web pages. These selectors are used in many ways. I could refer them in three basic ways. The universal selector `*` helps us override some CSS properties that have default values of display. On the other hand, the element selectors help us control some basic HTML structure like `header` and `footer`. Like any other selectors, class selector `.class` and id selector `#id` are very useful in some ways.

Git as a Version Control System helps us maintain constant contact between the local repository residing in our local machine and the remote or main repository that is on GitHub server, for instance. These two repositories, once linked together, offer many advantages to coders. This helps us keep our codes safe and share them on the remote repository with other participants or other coders. 

From now on, I can realize that  HTML, CSS, and Git  are parts of other pillars that lay down a solid foundation for us to begin this journey as full stack web developers. Let’s code and keep on coding!
